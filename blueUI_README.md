# blueUI
blue's UI suite for raid healing 


hello! this repository was created as a backup for my personal world of warcraft user interface. all elements of my UI are included here, and are mainly posted to fetch any profile strings if things go wrong, get corrupted, or if I want to share any packages as a resource. 

this UI is focused around raid healing in the retail version of WoW. it could be described as minimalistic with an emphasis on displaying all relevant and actionable information a healer would want at their disposal at a given time. if you want any more information on this UI, be sure to message me on discord: towersconnor(blue)#0117
